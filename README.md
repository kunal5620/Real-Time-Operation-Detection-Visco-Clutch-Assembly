# Real-Time-Operation-Detection-Visco-Clutch-Assembly

Visco Clutch Rolling and Bearing Operation Detection (Real-Time) 👁️‍🗨️⚙️

A real-time computer vision–based inspection system developed for detecting rolling and bearing operations of a Visco Clutch on a production line. The system ensures zero-defect manufacturing, seamless PLC integration, and 100% machine uptime.

🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a camera vision system combined with machine learning models to automatically detect and validate four critical Visco clutch operations across two production stations. The solution was fully integrated into the production environment using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to enable real-time decision-making and operator alerts.

The system successfully achieved:
- 0 internal customer complaints
- 100% machine uptime
- 0 breakdown time

🎯 Objectives

- Automate detection of Visco clutch rolling and bearing operations
- Eliminate manual inspection errors
- Provide real-time feedback to station operators
- Ensure seamless integration with existing PLC-controlled production lines
